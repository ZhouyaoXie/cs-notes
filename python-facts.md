### Key Features

#### Interpreted language

Languages that do not need to be compiled before it is run, e.g. Python, PHP, Ruby.

#### Dynamically typed language

You do not need to declare the type of a variable like you have to do with C or Java.

### Memory management

1. Python private heap space: all Python objects and data structures are stored in a private heap that's managed by Python's memory manager. Programmers do not have access to this private heap.

2. Python has an inbuilt garbage collector that recycles unused memory so that it can be made available to the heap space.

### Important Concepts

#### Namespace

A naming system to make sure that names are unique.

#### PYTHONPATH

An environment variable that is used when importing modules. The interpreter will look for the imported modules in various directories included in PYTHONPATH.

#### Global variables vs. Local variables

Declared outside of a function or in global space vs. declared inside a function

### Data Structures

#### List

Mutable, can hold different data types

#### Array

Mutable, hold a single data type

#### Tuple

Immutable, can hold different data types
