Notes on reading *Applying UML and Patterns: An Introduction to Object-Oriented Analysis and Design and Iterative Development, Third Edition* by Craig Larman.

# Chapter I. Object-Oriented Analysis and Development (OOA/D)

- Most critical skill: responsibility assignment. How should responsibilities be assigned to different software objects?

### Four steps of OOA
1. Define use cases: tell a story.
2. Define a domain model: identify key concepts and their associations (in the real-world problem domain)
3. Assign software object responsibilities and draw interaction diagrams (e.g. a sequence diagram shows a flow of events and how objects interact with each other)
4. Define design class diagrams: a static diagram illustrating attributes and methods of classes
